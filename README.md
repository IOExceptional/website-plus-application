# Website plus application

This repo is a test repo, to explore the simplest option of a website with a single page application embedded within it.

The following principles were important:
- NO task runner (gulp/grunt) because they are generally just TOO DAMN COMPLEX
- NO complicated UI framework to make the entire website an SPA

## Usage

To run:

```
npm start
```

To re-build javascript:

```
npm run build
```

I've used webstorm + lessc for automatic less compilation, otherwise you'd have to add in a npm script for that too.

### That's all folks!
